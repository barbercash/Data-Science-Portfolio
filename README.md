# ðŸ§  Data Science Portfolio by Cash Barber

Welcome to my data science portfolio â€” a curated collection of projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and end-to-end data science workflows.

Each project folder in this repository contains source code, Jupyter notebooks, documentation, and reports for real-world problems I've tackled using data.
