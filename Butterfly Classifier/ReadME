# 🦋 Butterfly Species Image Classifier

This project is a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based image classification system built to identify butterfly species from images. It was developed using a data set from Kaggle, which contains over 1,000 labeled images spanning 75 unique butterfly categories.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Model
```bash
python src/train.py
```
This will train the model and save it under `models/`.

### 3. Predict and Generate Submission
```bash
python src/predict.py
```
This will generate a `submission.csv` file inside `outputs/`.
